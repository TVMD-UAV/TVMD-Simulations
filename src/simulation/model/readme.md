# Drone Model Simulations
This project is aimed to realize different drone system in simulations with MATLAB2021b. 

# Drone models
## Ducted-fan drone
The controller for pure control and adaptive control is mainly based on the method proposed in [1: Roberts & Tayebi 2011].

## Bi-rotor drone
The system model for the bi-rotor is mainly referred to [2: Gress 2002] and [3: Kendoul et al. 2006] and the control allocation problem is adopted the method in [4: Qin et al. 2020].
